# axon-scale-demo

Based on seed project `idugalic:axon-java-spring-maven-seed`

This [Axon](https://axoniq.io/) **demo project** demonstrates different deployment strategies.
It is a Spring Boot application that uses two Spring profiles to separate application on `command` and `query` side.

## Development

This project is driven using [maven].

### 1. Run locally

This scenario covers running of Spring Boot application/s directly on the host machine. There is no cluster, and only one instance of the application/service is running at the same time.

There are two deployment strategies:
 - [monolithic version](#12-run-monolithic-version)
 - [microservices version](#13-run-microservices-version)

#### 1.1 Run Axon Server

You can [download](https://download.axoniq.io/axonserver/AxonServer.zip) a ZIP file with AxonServer as a standalone JAR. This will also give you the AxonServer CLI and information on how to run and configure the server.

#### 1.2 Run monolithic version

`command` and `query` Spring profiles are activated, grouping command and query components into one monolithic application.

You can run the following command to start monolithic version locally:
```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=command,query
```

**Verify**:
```
$ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"value" : "1000"}' 'http://localhost:8080/commandcards'
```
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/querycards
```

> We use H2 SQL database. Web console is enabled, and it should be available on `/h2-console` URL (eg. `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`). Datasource URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:axon-scale-demo-command,query`

#### 1.3 Run microservices version

`command` and `query` services/applications are separately deployed. Each service activated appropriate Spring profile (`command` or `query`).

You can run the following commands to start microservices version locally:
```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=command -Dserver.port=8081
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=query -Dserver.port=8082

```

> Each application use its own H2 SQL database. 
> H2 Web console of command application is enabled, and it should be available on `/h2-console` URL (eg. `http://localhost:8081/h2-console`). Datasource URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:axon-scale-demo-command`.
> H2 Web console of query application is enabled, and it should be available on `/h2-console` URL (eg. `http://localhost:8082/h2-console`). Datasource URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:axon-scale-demo-query`.

**Verify**:

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"value" : "1000"}' 'http://localhost:8081/commandcards'
```
```
$ curl http://localhost:8082/querycards
```


### 2 Run/Deploy to local Kubernetes cluster

This scenario covers deployment of our containerized (Docker) applications/services to the Kubernetes cluster, so we can scale services better.


There are two deployment strategies:
 - [monolithic version](#221-deploy-monolithic-version)
 - [microservices version](#222-deploy-microservices-version)

#### 2.1 Build the Docker image

Build the application image with [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) directly to a Docker daemon. This uses the `docker` command line tool and requires that you have docker available on your PATH.

```
$ ./mvnw compile jib:dockerBuild -Dimage=axon-scale-demo
```

> Jib separates your application into multiple layers, splitting dependencies from classes. Now you donâ€™t have to wait for Docker to rebuild your entire Java application - just deploy the layers that changed.

#### 2.2 Deploy Docker stack to Kubernetes

You typically use docker-compose for local development because it can build and works only on a single docker engine. Docker stack and docker service commands require a `Docker Swarm (configured by defaut)` or `Kubernetes cluster`, and they are step towards production.

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) comes with Kubernetes and the Compose controller built-in, and enabling it is as simple as ticking a box in the settings.

Now, we can use Docker Compose file and native Docker API for [`stacks`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack/) to manage applications/services on local Kubernetes cluster.

##### 2.2.1 Deploy monolithic version
`command` and `query` Spring profiles are activated, grouping command and query components into one [monolithic application](docker-compose.monolith.yml).
```
$ docker stack deploy --orchestrator=kubernetes -c docker-compose.monolith.yml axon-sacle-demo-stack
```

##### 2.2.2 Deploy microservices version
`command` and `query` services/applications are separately deployed. [Each service](docker-compose.microservices.yml) is activating appropriate Spring profile (`command` or `query`).
```
$ docker stack deploy --orchestrator=kubernetes -c docker-compose.microservices.yml axon-sacle-demo-stack
```

#### 2.3 Kubernetes Web UI (Dashboard)

Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot your containerized application, and manage the cluster resources.

The Dashboard UI is not deployed by default. To deploy it, run the following command:
```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/aio/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml

```
You can access Dashboard by running the following command:
```
$ kubectl proxy
```
Kubectl will make Dashboard available at [http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy](http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy)

#### 2.4 Verify

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"value" : "1000"}' 'http://localhost:8081/commandcards'
```
```
$ curl http://localhost:8082/querycards
```

#### Remove Docker stack
```
$ docker stack rm --orchestrator=kubernetes axon-sacle-demo-stack
```


### Run tests

This project comes with some rudimentary tests as a good starting
point for writing your own. Use the following command to execute the
tests using Maven:

```
$ ./mvnw test
```
